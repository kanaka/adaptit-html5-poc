## Adapt It HTML5 Proof of Concept

The current [Adapt It project](http://code.google.com/p/adaptit/) is
a very large cross-platform C++/wxWidgets project. One way to increase
the reach of Adapt It is to port the project to run in modern browsers
using HTML5 technologies and Javascript.

This project contains experiments to prove out HTML5 concepts that
will be relevant for an HTML5 port of Adapt It.
